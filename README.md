# ICASSP_InCar_SS
Please find the listening samples at the provided "link." In this demonstration, we showcase the results using the latest microphone configuration, mic_set2.

We have organized the results into eight pages, each presenting an example from the various studied scenarios:

No audio played through the car loudspeakers.
Music-related content:
2. Music played with an SNR of 0dB relative to the Driver's speech in the reference microphone.

Music played with an SNR of 10dB relative to the Driver's speech in the reference microphone.
Music played with an SNR of 20dB relative to the Driver's speech in the reference microphone.
Speech-related content:
5. Speech played with an SNR of 0dB relative to the Driver's speech in the reference microphone.

Speech played with an SNR of 10dB relative to the Driver's speech in the reference microphone.
Speech played with an SNR of 20dB relative to the Driver's speech in the reference microphone.
In case of any issues with the website, here is a backup example: We played music-related content with an SNR of 10dB.
